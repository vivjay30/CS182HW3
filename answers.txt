Comparison of results from Parts 3-5:

Running the DFS without any heuristics gives 56734 nodes explored at a time of 10.6 seconds. Running it with the "on the fly" forward checking gives 7095 nodes explored at a time of 10.7 seconds. It is interesting that this actualy takes more time, however the overhead comes from the fact that for each forward check, we are doing checking the domain of 81 variables, requiring checking 27 spots for each variable. A more dynamic forward checking would definitely reduce this speed.

Running most constrained function explored 787 nodes at a time of 1.0 seconds. This reduction makes sense since we are more directly approaching the goal state. Running it with forward checking explored 734 nodes at 1.8 seconds. As expected the nodes explored are fewer, however it is not as big a reduction as you might think. This shows that following the most constrained variable rarely leads to inconsistent branches since the variable about to become inconsistent would be explored first.
